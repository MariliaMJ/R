##Abstract

Analysis of loans in the USA. Concerns in finding patterns of behavior in loans purchase, including
temporal, income, possibly type of carreer, geographic and others.

##Introduction

As the economical crisis spreaded throughtout the world as the consuming need and lack of job opportunities, it is to 
expect the need to have more and more money to cover one's habits. This dataset can provide enough information for us answer a few initial questions:

I  ) People are needing more money throughout the time;
II ) Is there any season on which loans are more requested?;
III) Those with lower income get more loans(IncomeRange);
IV ) Those who make less money will likely be in debt;(AmountDelinquent)
V  ) Not employed people will have smaller amount loans, as they don't have income(EmployementStatus, LoanOriginalAmount);
VI ) Is there any state where the loans requests are bigger? Does it  give any insight about the state?(BorrowerState, LoanOriginalAmount)
VII) What's the influence of credit scores in amount of loans, debit and income? If any?(creditScore, Loan, OriginalAmount, )

As it is investigated, first thoughts on the answers may or may not be confirmed. From all the variables, not all, as the questins show, will be useful for the purpose of this work.
